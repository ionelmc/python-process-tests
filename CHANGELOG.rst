=========

2.1.0 (2020-07-23)
------------------

* Applied the cookiecutter-pylibrary templates.
* ``TestProcess`` will use ``universal_newlines`` by default for the contained ``subprocess.Popen`` to make sure line buffering is actually
  used. This also fixes warnings on Python 3.

2.x (???)
---------

* Lots of wild stuff.
